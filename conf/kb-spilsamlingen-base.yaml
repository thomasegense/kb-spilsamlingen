#
# This is the base config for the project.
#
# It will be used when running 'mvn jetty:run' and is expected to be deployed along with the WAR when running under tomcat.
#
# The base config will be automatically merged with the 'environment' config when accessed through the
# application config system.
#
# Sensitive information such as machine names and user/passwords MUST NOT be part of this config but should be stated
# with placeholders and/or overridden in the 'environment' and 'local' configurations.
#

# Sample configuration values below. Remove from concrete application

config:

  # Inline expansion works just as full value expansion. For "userhome", the system property "user.home" is used.
  # As it has no default, an exception will be thrown by the configuration system if not defined and the value
  # is requested. Note: Expansion is done at config load time.
  userhome: "Home sweet ${user.home}"

  # Auto update of the ServiceConfig when the YAML files changes on storage.
  # Default is that auto updates are disabled. Read the JavaDoc for ServiceConfig.java for details.
  # Do not blindly enable this as the concrete application needs to have support for changing configuration
  autoupdate:
    enabled: ${env:AUTOUPDATE_ENABLED:-${autoupdate.enabled:-false}}
    intervalms: ${env:AUTOUPDATE_INTERVALMS:-${autoupdate.intervalms:-60000}}
