#
# This is the base config for the project.
#
# It will be used when running 'mvn jetty:run' and is expected to be deployed along with the WAR when running under tomcat.
#
# The base config will be automatically merged with the 'environment' config when accessed through the
# application config system.
#
# Sensitive information such as machine names and user/passwords MUST NOT be part of this config but should be stated
# with placeholders and/or overridden in the 'environment' and 'local' configurations.
#

# Sample configuration values below. Remove from concrete application

config:



  limits:
    min: 10
    max: 100

  # Expansion is provided using https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/StringSubstitutor.html
  # The two common ones are system properties and environment variables, as demonstrated below

  # System properties are available: See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html
  # Application specific properties can be defined in a tomcat context or with -Dmy.property=foo as Java argument

  # In general it is fine form to allow for multiple different ways of overriding the value when a property is dependent
  # on the environment, e.g. hardware resources. Overriding through environment variables works very well for
  # Docker/Kubernetes setups and overriding through system properties works well for tomcat deployments.

  # See "batcher.threads", "backend.password" and "backend.db" below for realistic examples.

  batcher:
    # In this example, the number of threads can be controlled with environment BATCH_THREADS=7,
    # system properties -Dbatch.threads=7 or explicit overriding in the 'environment' or 'local' YAML config files.
    # If none of these are provided, the value 5 will be used

    # When using this pattern, try and align environment and system properties keys to match each other:
    # Environment is uppercase with underscore as delimiter, system properties are lowercase with dot as delimiter.
    threads: ${env:BATCH_THREADS:-${batch.threads:-5}}

  # Inline expansion works just as full value expansion. For "userhome", the system property "user.home" is used.
  # As it has no default, an exception will be thrown by the configuration system if not defined and the value
  # is requested. Note: Expansion is done at config load time.
  userhome: "Home sweet ${user.home}"

  # Fallbacks for missing system properties can be defined with :-
  # If "nonexisting.property" is not set, the value of "fallback" will be "87"
  fallback: ${nonexisting.property:-87}

  backend:
    # Environment variables are available with the prefix env.
    # Normally this would be written with fallback to system properties like the "password" case below
    user: ${env:DB_USERNAME:-exampleUser}
    # Flexible definition of a password, checking first environment then system properties and throwing an exception if
    # it is not provided in any of them. Note that the env: must come first.
    # Not having a default is the standard way to define username/password as default password is often a security risks
    password: ${env:DB_PASSWORD:-examplePass}
    # Flexible definition of an URL, with fallback to a concrete value. Note that the env: must come first:
    # See the extended explanation for the "threads" case below
    db: ${env:DB_URL:-${db.url:-http://localhost:12345/mydb}}

  # Plain definition of values, which for demonstration purposes are overwritten in kb-spilsamlingen-local.yaml.
  # Since expansion values can also be overwritten in subsequent YAML configs, there is rarely any reason for sticking
  # to plain definitions of values. The principle used in "backend.password" and "backend.db" is preferred
  alternative:
    user: "altuser"
    password: "altpassword"
    db: "http://localhost:23456/mydb2"

  # Auto update of the ServiceConfig when the YAML files changes on storage.
  # Default is that auto updates are disabled. Read the JavaDoc for ServiceConfig.java for details.
  # Do not blindly enable this as the concrete application needs to have support for changing configuration
  autoupdate:
    enabled: ${env:AUTOUPDATE_ENABLED:-${autoupdate.enabled:-false}}
    intervalms: ${env:AUTOUPDATE_INTERVALMS:-${autoupdate.intervalms:-60000}}
